Hi, I'm Balajee N, a fresher with a B.Tech degree in Computer Science. I'm currently learning data science at Guvi IIT-M, where I'm gaining practical knowledge and hands-on experience in areas such as data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

I'm passionate about using data to solve complex problems and create meaningful insights that drive business decisions. In my free time, I enjoy participating in hackathons and building data-driven projects.

I'm excited to share my projects with the GitHub community and welcome any feedback or suggestions. You can reach me at [balajeenagarajan437@gmail.com] to connect or collaborate.
